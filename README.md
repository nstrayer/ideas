My todo list of data science/ visualization projects. 


1. A scrolling viz that introduces user to different probability distributions. E.g. Normal -> Logistic -> Chi Squared...
2. Scrolling viz of a choropleth that explores the farmers market dataset. See nstrayer/farmersMarkets readme for different statistics to show.

My todo list of data science/ visualization projects. 


1. A scrolling viz that introduces user to different probability distributions. E.g. Normal -> Logistic -> Chi Squared...
2. Scrolling barchart viz that explores the farmers market dataset. See nstrayer/farmersMarkets readme for different statistics to show. 
3. A new and unique way to look at wind and current data. Perhaps a mouseover to see wind levels interactive situation.

My todo list of data science/ visualization/ app projects. 

- [ ] [How to clip voronoi](http://bl.ocks.org/jasondavies/d70baf034448ef7a52d1). One year later. 
- [ ] A scrolling story of the bayesian and frequentist framework. 
  - Lego blocks for the win. The adventures of Uncle Frequentist and Sister Bayesian. 
- [ ] Regression data exploration visualization
- [ ] Regression evolutionary algorithm for dealing with huge numbers of regressors. 
- [ ] Visualization of james-stein estimator shrinkage. 
  - Allow the user to choose the underlying distribution that the groups draw their true means from and then show how different estimators reduce the overall squared error. 
- [ ] Analysis of grant proposal word usage. E.g. how successful grants that include the word "microbiome" in them are. 
- [ ] Bayesian methods for meta analysis
  - Utilizing a weight tied to the quality of the study to modify priors. Perhaps just in the utilization of credibility intervals. 
- [ ] Intro to website that allows you to mess around with the gamma distributions by messing with parameters alpha and beta. 
- [ ] A d3 library that includes a series of common data explorations plots for stats. Could be turned into an R package as well.
- [ ] Counting problems in probability are hard (for me). Making a visualization could help both me and future students.
- [ ] Basic set theory interactive visualization/tutorial. 
  - Using [this](https://github.com/benfred/venn.js/) library should make this rather easy. 
- [ ] A new and unique way to look at wind and current data. Perhaps a mouseover to see wind levels interactive situation. 
- [ ] A neural network to recognize date types based upon a string. 
- [ ] Switching voronoi: animate the change between different data. 
- [ ] Cities: Population statistics, locations etc. Let's move some dots.

My todo list of data science/ visualization projects. 

- Current wildfire locations in pretty format. [data](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/active-fire-data)
  - There could be a grid chart bellow to show how many fires are in different places. Sort by state. 
- A new and unique way to look at wind and current data. Perhaps a mouseover to see wind levels interactive situation. 
- A neural network to recognize date types based upon a string. 
- Switching voronoi: animate the change between different data. 
- Cities: Population statistics, locations etc. Let's move some dots.

My todo list of data science/ visualization projects. 


1. A scrolling viz that introduces user to different probability distributions. E.g. Normal -> Logistic -> Chi Squared...
2. Scrolling barchart viz that explores the farmers market dataset. See nstrayer/farmersMarkets readme for different statistics to show. 
3. A new and unique way to look at wind and current data. Perhaps a mouseover to see wind levels interactive situation. 
4. A neural network to recognize date types based upon a string. 
5. A tiny d3 library for doing wrapped scaling. Menu design or stuff like [this](http://blog.vctr.me/bart/). I have the code for this already in the [What do Farmers Markets Sell visualization](http://nickstrayer.me/farmersMarkets). [Repo](http://www.github.com/ntrayer/farmersMarkets).
